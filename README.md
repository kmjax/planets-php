See checklist above for status of each project objective.

#### PREVIOUS STATUS MESSAGES

- 100% Bootstrap classes and table styling applied to the webpage.
- 75% Completed. Planet links to Google Space Maps are now functional and open up in a new page (tab). All that is left is applying Bootstrap to the page and styling to the table.
- 70% Completed. The core content of the web page is now in place. Planetary data is fetched and displayed in a table. Currently, there is no styling applied to the results and as a result it is ugly.
- 20% Completed. Database table PLANETS created and populated with all planetary information from the spreadsheet. The planets table was dumped and stored in the repository.
- 10% Completed. Information gathered and stored in a spreadsheet for all of our solar system's 8 planets.

_NOTE: Since these live assignment pages are stored on Surge.sh, static images of the webpage output are displayed instead of a live page. This is due to Surge.sh not being able to host dynamic PHP web pages._
